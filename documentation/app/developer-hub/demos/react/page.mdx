# React dApp Demo
The React SDK is under development. Once the React SDK is published, this page will be updated.

There is now a "React dApp" guide in "Demos → UI React → React dApp" that uses `@betswirl/ui-react`. This page is also called "React dApp". Should we rename one of them to avoid confusion? Is this page about a different React SDK (without UI components)?
