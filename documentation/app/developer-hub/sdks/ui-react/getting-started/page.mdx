# Getting Started

## What is @betswirl/ui-react?

The **@betswirl/ui-react** is a React library that provides ready-to-use UI components and useful hooks for building casino applications on top of the BetSwirl protocol.

### Key Features:

- **Complete UI Components** - Fully functional React components for casino games (Dice, Roulette, Coin Toss, Keno, Wheel, etc.) that you can directly integrate into your application
- **Useful Hooks** - React hooks to interact with the BetSwirl protocol, manage game state, and handle betting logic

## Current situation

The documentation for @betswirl/ui-react is currently **under construction**. However, you can explore two complete demos built on top of ui-react:

- **[React dApp Demo](/developer-hub/demos/ui-react/react)** - A full-featured casino dApp built with React
- **[Farcaster Mini App Demo](/developer-hub/demos/ui-react/miniapp)** - A Farcaster Mini App implementation

These demos serve as practical examples and reference implementations while the documentation is being developed.

## Future Migration

> **Important**: In the future, all **hooks and contexts** from `@betswirl/ui-react` will be moved to the [React SDK](/developer-hub/sdks/react/getting-started). Only the **UI components** will remain in `@betswirl/ui-react`.

This separation will provide:
- **UI components** (in `@betswirl/ui-react`) - Ready-to-use visual components
- **Logic and hooks** (in React SDK) - Reusable hooks and contexts for custom implementations
