# Client Functions

This page lists all functions accessible from a BetSwirl client. These functions are particularly useful if you're using one of the two available clients:

- **[External BetSwirl Client (Wagmi) ](/developer-hub/sdks/core/getting-started#1-with-an-external-betswirl-client)** - For multi-chain applications with Wagmi
- **[Native BetSwirl Client (Viem)](/developer-hub/sdks/core/getting-started#2-with-the-native-betswirl-client-viem)** - For simple applications with Viem

<Callout type="info">
  100% of the functions below are also available without using a client.
</Callout>
