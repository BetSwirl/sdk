# Getting Started

## Current situation

Currently, there is **no React SDK** available. The React SDK is under development and will be published in the future.

## Alternative: UI React SDK

While waiting for the React SDK to be published, you can use the **[UI React SDK](/developer-hub/sdks/ui-react/getting-started)** which provides:

- **Ready-to-use components** - Complete React components to quickly integrate casino games into your application
- **Useful hooks** - React hooks to interact with the BetSwirl protocol

### Future Migration

All **hooks and contexts** from the UI React SDK will be separated from `@betswirl/ui-react` to be integrated into the React SDK. This will allow a clear separation between:
- UI components (remains in `@betswirl/ui-react`)
- Logic and hooks (in the future React SDK)
