# Client Functions

The **@betswirl/wagmi-provider** provides access to **exactly the same functions** as the native Viem client from **@betswirl/sdk-core**. You can find the complete list of functions in the [Core SDK Client Functions](/developer-hub/sdks/core/client-functions) documentation.

The only difference is that instead of using a Viem client configuration, you use a Wagmi configuration to initialize the client.
