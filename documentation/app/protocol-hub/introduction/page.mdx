## Our Story

The journey of BetSwirl began in May 2021 when a small but passionate team of three — a Solidity developer, a frontend developer, and a product designer—saw the untapped potential of Web3 to power a fair, decentralized gaming experience. With the launch of Chainlink's VRF (Verifiable Random Function), the technology we needed to create a provably fair on-chain casino finally arrived, and BetSwirl was born.

### Building the Foundation

In late 2021, we took our first major step by launching the BetSwirl dApp on the Polygon testnet. With an initial strategic sale of $80k, we secured the funding to build out more features and expand our vision. By February 2022, BetSwirl made its grand debut on the Polygon mainnet, [introducing our first games to the public](https://betswirl.medium.com/episode-1-betswirl-joins-the-party-and-heres-what-you-should-know-1a0e9e20d4bb).

However, the road wasn't always easy. As we began a private sale in Q1 2022, unforeseen geopolitical challenges and a downturn in the market impacted our goals. Our Initial DEX Offering (IDO) raised $240k—short of our $480k target—but it fueled the [launch of BETS](https://betswirl.medium.com/episode-3-the-bets-token-8c4b7ae0fe03), our native token, which set us on a path to resilience and innovation.

### Expansion and Partnerships

April 2022 marked a significant milestone as BetSwirl expanded to the BNB Chain and Avalanche, bringing our platform to a wider audience of blockchain enthusiasts. Then, in May, we [launched our B2B offering](https://betswirl.medium.com/betswirl-set-to-usher-in-new-suite-of-b2b-services-8e600cc3cc39), allowing other protocols to incorporate our games into their ecosystems with white-label solutions.

### A Future Filled with Innovation

In Q4 2023, we launched our second PvP game, [Coin Flip Battle](https://betswirl.medium.com/introducing-coin-flip-battle-pvp-c4cbdd3fd434), bringing an even more engaging experience to our players. Then, in April 2024, we released our [Telegram bot SwirlBot](https://betswirl.medium.com/swirlbot-the-game-changer-on-betswirls-decentralized-platform-eaa77e442833) (not currently available), making it even easier for our community to engage with BetSwirl's features directly from their messaging app.

### BetSwirl V2 - Revolutionizing the Protocol

In November 2024, we launched **BetSwirl V2**, a major evolution of our protocol that introduced three groundbreaking features designed to maximize marketing impact and user engagement:

- **Affiliate System**: Our comprehensive affiliate program allows partners to earn rewards by promoting BetSwirl games, creating a powerful network effect that drives user acquisition and retention.

- **Freebets System**: We implemented an innovative freebets distribution mechanism that rewards users with risk-free betting opportunities, significantly increasing user engagement and platform adoption.

- **Leaderboards**: Competitive leaderboards create gamification elements that encourage user participation and foster a vibrant, competitive community around our games.

These features have transformed BetSwirl from a simple gaming platform into a comprehensive ecosystem that leverages social dynamics and incentives to drive unprecedented growth.

### Farcaster Integration - Breaking New Ground

February 2025 marked another milestone as we launched our **miniapp on Farcaster**, the leading decentralized social media platform. This strategic move proved to be a game-changer:

- **Top 2 Performance**: We maintained a top 2 position among Farcaster apps for an impressive 2 months, demonstrating the strong appeal of our gaming experience in the social web3 space.

- **Massive Reach**: Our Farcaster integration generated over **1 million notifications** sent to users, creating unprecedented awareness and engagement.

- **Freebets Distribution**: We successfully distributed **750,000 freebets** through the platform, driving user acquisition and platform adoption.

- **Daily Active Users**: The miniapp attracted **several thousand daily users**, proving that web3 gaming can thrive in social environments and creating a new paradigm for decentralized gaming distribution.

This success on Farcaster has opened new avenues for user acquisition and demonstrated the potential of integrating gaming experiences within social web3 platforms.

With each milestone, BetSwirl has grown, learning from the past and building towards a future of innovation, fairness, and community-driven development. Today, we're tirelessly working on BetSwirl v2, with exciting new features on the horizon.

Our journey reflects a vision—a decentralized gaming ecosystem where users can trust in provable fairness, enhanced utility, and a seamless experience across chains. At BetSwirl, the game has only just begun.
