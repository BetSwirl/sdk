# ðŸ’§ BETS Revenue Sharing via Liquidity Provision

BetSwirl's innovative staking system goes beyond traditional token staking. Instead of locking your tokens, you provide liquidity and earn real yield from platform revenueâ€”the Gamble-Fi way.

## ðŸ§  Overview

<Callout type="info">
  BetSwirl distributes **30% of all platform revenue** â€” generated from both casino and sports betting across all chains â€” to users who provide liquidity in the BETS/ETH pool on Unichain (Uniswap v4).
</Callout>

This system allows BETS holders to earn **real yield in USDC** by supporting the protocol's liquidity and volume, with **no custodial staking or lockups**.

Rewards are tracked and distributed via the **Merkl protocol**, ensuring a transparent, verifiable, and gas-efficient claim process.

## ðŸ’¸ How Rewards Work

Revenue is shared in USDC, and LPs earn based on:

- **How long your liquidity is active** in the pool
- **Trading volume your position supports**
- **Your liquidity range** (more concentrated = more impact)

<Callout type="warning">
  Merkl automatically tracks LP activity off-chain and publishes claimable Merkle proofs â€” LPs can then claim their rewards on-chain.
</Callout>

**No staking or extra contracts. Just provide liquidity and claim.**

## âœ… How to Start Earning

### Use Gamma Vault for Automation

Don't want to actively manage LP ranges? Use the **Gamma Uniswap v4 vault**, which automates your LP strategy:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Bridge BETS

Bridge your BETS tokens to Unichain network using the [BetSwirl Bridge](https://www.betswirl.com/base/BETS/bridge).

### Step 2: Bridge ETH

Bridge ETH to Unichain for liquidity provision using [Jumper Exchange](https://jumper.exchange/?fromChain=130&toChain=130&toToken=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).

### Step 3: Provide Liquidity

Provide liquidity in the BETS/ETH pool on [Gamma Vault](https://app.gamma.xyz/vault/uniswapv4/unichain/details/eth-bets-3000-gaussian).
</Steps>

### ðŸ§  Current Gamma Strategy

The Gamma vault currently uses a **wider bell curve strategy** â€” balancing stable in-range coverage with increased Merkl rewards.

This mitigates volatility by being less concentrated than Gamma's typical exponential ranges, and avoids the "order book" shape, whichâ€”while more reactiveâ€”would result in lower Merkl APR.

This setup gives LPs both **sustainable yield** and **strategic exposure**.


## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits

- **No Lockups**: Unlike traditional staking, your tokens remain liquid and accessible.
- **Real Revenue**: Earn from actual platform usage, not token inflation.
- **Cross-Chain**: Revenue comes from all chains: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Base.
- **Automated**: Use Gamma vault for hands-free liquidity management.
