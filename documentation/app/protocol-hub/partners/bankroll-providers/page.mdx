## What is a Bankroll Provider?

Bankroll providers are liquidity providers who supply funds to the BetSwirl protocol to finance casino bets. Unlike affiliates who build frontends, bankroll providers focus on providing the financial backbone that enables the betting ecosystem to function.

### Key Benefits:
- **20% of house edge revenue** from financed bets
- **Passive income** from liquidity provision
- **No frontend required** - pure DeFi participation
- **Token-based freebets and leaderboards** for marketing

## How Bankroll Providers Work

### Core Function
Bankroll providers supply liquidity to the BetSwirl protocol, which is then used to pay out winning bets. In return, they earn 20% of the house edge from all bets financed by their bankroll.

### Marketing Tools
While bankroll providers don't build frontends, they can create:
- **Freebets** using their own tokens
- **Leaderboards** with their token as requirements
- **Promotional campaigns** across affiliate frontends

These marketing tools help bankroll providers promote their tokens and attract users to their ecosystem.
