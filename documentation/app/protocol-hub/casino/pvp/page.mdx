# ‚öîÔ∏è Player vs Player Games

BetSwirl's PvP (Player vs Player) games bring the thrill of competitive gaming to the blockchain. These games allow players to challenge each other directly, creating exciting head-to-head battles where only luck determines the winner.

Unlike traditional casino games where players compete against the house, PvP games create a dynamic environment where players can host games, set their own rules, and compete directly against other players.

## How PvP Games Work

PvP games on BetSwirl follow a unique model where players can become hosts and create their own gambling sessions. This creates a dynamic ecosystem where anyone can participate as either a host or a player.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Game Creation
A host creates a game by setting parameters like buy-in amount, number of players, deadline, and game rules. They can choose to make the game public or private.

### Step 2: Player Registration
Players join the game by paying the buy-in amount. Once all seats are filled or the deadline is reached, the game is ready to begin.

### Step 3: Game Resolution
The game is resolved using Chainlink VRF for provably fair random outcomes, ensuring complete transparency and trust.

### Step 4: Prize Distribution
Winners receive their share of the prize pool, while the host benefits from a portion of the house edge, creating incentives for game hosting.

Host creates a Russian Roulette game by setting the number of open seats, the buy-in, a deadline date and the winning percentage. They can also choose to make the game public or private. Once all seats are filled or the deadline arrives, the game is ready for resolution. When the trigger is pulled, winners are determined, sharing the total prize pool minus the house edge. Importantly, the host benefits from this house edge, receiving 50% of it, which adds an element of profitability for them.",

## üè¶ Host Benefits

In PvP games, hosts play a crucial role in creating gaming opportunities and are rewarded for their participation. Hosts receive a portion of the house edge, typically 50%, providing them with a profitable incentive to create and manage games.

<Callout type="warning">
  Hosting PvP games can be profitable, but requires careful management of game parameters and player engagement.
